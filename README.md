## Guidelines
- Use branches: Always create a new branch before starts working on a new day. Use a consistent naming convention for branches, such as fw22_0065-Day-1, where fw22_0065 is your student code and Day-1 is the day you started working on the branch.

- Pull before push: Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before pushing any changes to your branch.
 
- Never ever: Never push any code to the main branch.

- Use commit messages: Write descriptive commit messages that explain the changes you made.

- Follow best practices: Follow best practices for coding, such as using consistent indentation, avoiding hard-coded values, and using meaningful variable names.
